                        This past week was week two of our final project sprint. 
                        We had three days to work in class (Mon-Wed), before breaking 
                        for Thanksgiving. Next week we will have two more class days 
                        to work on the final project (Mon and Tue), before presenting 
                        to our classmates on Wednesday, and presenting to the general 
                        public on Thursday! This week I tried to keep a daily log of 
                        what I worked on.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Monday</h3>

                    <p>
                        On Monday, I created a new 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" title="Wikipedia: Kanban">kanban</a> 
                        board for the project. Last week made me realize that time will 
                        play an important role in how much I will be able to get done, 
                        and I wanted to map out a project “prototype” — something with 
                        all of the core functionality, that I could then build on as time allowed.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="figure">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/mpm2-prototype-kanban.png" alt="Prototype Kanban Board">
                        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Prototype Kanban Board</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        At this point I had a synth with parameter controls, and visuals that DID NOT 
                        yet react to the synth sounds. My synth parameters would store their values in state, 
                        and my first task this week was to try to store these values in my database. 
                        It was pretty straightforward to move the variables themselves, but I quickly 
                        ran into as issue with creating too many API calls. When I would move the 
                        slider once, it would send hundreds of calls to the database. This would 
                        cause a “429 — too many requests" error. To remedy this, I decided to use 
                        a technique called 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)" title="Wikipedia: Polling">polling</a> 
                        — basically, checking for updates at regular time 
                        intervals. I found that if I limited myself to one API call per second, I 
                        could mostly avoid 429 errors.
                    </p>

                        My next step was to clean up my code. During the process of adding new 
                        features and trying to fix bugs, I would often “comment out” various 
                        fixes. This allowed me to see what I had tried, what had worked, and 
                        what did not. Now that I had some functioning code, I went through and 
                        deleted unused code, cleaned up existing code, and added explanatory comments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After lunch (a quick stop at Sahara with Sam and Anna, and a tour of 
                        <a href="http://nymbl.healthcare/" title="Nymbl's Website">Nymbl’s</a> 
                        offices), I still had one more problem I wanted to tackle: I was separating 
                        my synth and synth control components, and knew that they wouldn’t have 
                        any common parents to pass state up to. This meant that I need some way 
                        to store my Boolean value for triggering synth sounds. One strategy that 
                        I attempted was using 
                        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" title="React Documentation: Context">React context</a>. 
                        Context allows you to store values outside of the parent-child tree. This 
                        was a new aspect of React to me, so first I had to research this technique, 
                        before then attempting to implement it.
                    </p>

                        After that failed to work, I tried using conditional rendering and then 
                        async functions before finally realizing that I might be able to solve 
                        my problem with a simple line of PHP in the API call. At this point it 
                        was 6pm, and I decided to go home and sleep on the problem.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Tuesday</h3>

                    <p>
                        Overslept my alarm — ended up being late to my workout class :(
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sleeping on my API call problem worked! I got into class this morning and 
                        ended up solving my problem in the first 30 minutes!

                        I spent most of the day working on getting my visualizer to react to my 
                        synth audio. It would work, but only in very brief flashes. Today 
                        was another fairly frustrating day — as I worked on one problem all 
                        day and found no solutions. I had both Ian and Justin help me, but 
                        since I was using a library (Pts.js) that they weren’t familiar with, 
                        neither of them had much luck. I stayed until 7pm, felt like I made 
                        no progress, and went home feeling a little defeated.

                    <h3>Wednesday</h3>

                    <p>
                        Wednesday was our final day before Thanksgiving break, and our last day 
                        to get hands on feedback from the instructors or our classmates. With 
                        only two days of coding remaining when we get back, it was pretty vital 
                        that we be in a good position when we left on Wednesday. Since I was still 
                        solidly blocked with my visualizer issue, Justin told me that he wanted 
                        me to check in at 3pm — and that if I couldn’t solve it by then, then I 
                        may have to consider pivoting on that aspect of my project.
                    </p>

                        In the morning, Ian helped me refactor my Synth and Visuals into one 
                        component. We thought that this would be helpful when attempting to 
                        analyze the sound and have the visuals react.

                        Since time was short, several of us decided to call in a pizza order. 
                        I asked for extra ranch. A good slice of pizza is wasted without some 
                        ranch to dip it in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After lunch, I again worked with Ian in an attempt to fix my visualizer 
                        problem. Ian was leaving for Denver at 2pm, so time was pretty short. 
                        Ian had worked with me throughout the morning, and was now fairly familiar 
                        with Pts.js — this meant that his feedback was likely my last shot at 
                        completing this aspect of my project. As 2pm rolled around, we were 
                        both feeling pretty dejected — we had tried a whole host of fixes for 
                        the problem, but so far, nothing was working. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After Ian left, I went out and laid on the couch in the hallway. 
                        I wanted a break from my code, and, as often happens, this gave 
                        my mind a chance to approach the problem from a different angle. 
                        I realized that we had several parts working independently, 
                        and that there seemed to be no reason why we shouldn’t be able 
                        to combine these to get a functioning visualizer. I went back to 
                        our workroom, grabbed my laptop, and  sequestered myself in a side 
                        office to make one last attempt at fixing my code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I pulled up two different, partially working versions of the code. I began 
                        by commenting things out, section by section, trying to figure out what 
                        was breaking my visualizer. Finally, around 2:45, I commented out a small 
                        “if statement”, and suddenly the visualizer worked! It seems that we had 
                        left some code from a previous fix in our new version, and that it had 
                        been breaking everything else. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about 
                        getting my visualizer to work. I had been pretty bummed about the idea of 
                        giving up on this aspect of my project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fixing that issue completed my prototype build. I spent the next few hours 
                        adding additional styling, creating a kanban board for build 2, and cleaning 
                        up my code before finally heading out for the holiday weekend!

                    <h3>Thursday</h3>

                    <p>
                        I have a pretty large extended family in the Central Kentucky area, so 
                        everyone converged on my parents house for a Thanksgiving feast! I’ll 
                        let the pictures do the talking — I did not do much coding today.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Weekend</h3>

                    <p>
                        I managed to work some more on my code over the weekend (as well as catching up 
                        on week 10 and week 11’s blog posts). I mostly worked on some small features, 
                        and planned out what major features I would start tackling on Monday. Some of 
                        the features that I added: fixing the polling bounce issue, adding controls 
                        for manipulating the visualizer, and figuring out how to set an EQ range.
                    </p>
