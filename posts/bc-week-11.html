                        This past week was week two of our final project sprint. 
                        We had three days to work in class (Mon-Wed), before breaking 
                        for Thanksgiving. Next week we will have two more class days 
                        to work on the final project (Mon and Tue), before presenting 
                        to our classmates on Wednesday, and presenting to the general 
                        public on Thursday! This week I tried to keep a daily log of 
                        what I worked on.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Monday</h3>

                    <p>
                        On Monday, I created a new 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" title="Wikipedia: Kanban">kanban</a> 
                        board for the project. Last week made me realize that time will 
                        play an important role in how much I will be able to get done, 
                        and I wanted to map out a project “prototype” — something with 
                        all of the core functionality, that I could then build on as time allowed.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="figure">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/mpm2-prototype-kanban.png" alt="Prototype Kanban Board">
                        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Prototype Kanban Board</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        At this point I had a synth with parameter controls, and visuals that DID NOT 
                        yet react to the synth sounds. My synth parameters would store their values in state, 
                        and my first task this week was to try to store these values in my database. 
                        It was pretty straightforward to move the variables themselves, but I quickly 
                        ran into as issue with creating too many API calls. When I would move the 
                        slider once, it would send hundreds of calls to the database. This would 
                        cause a “429 — too many requests" error. To remedy this, I decided to use 
                        a technique called 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)" title="Wikipedia: Polling">polling</a> 
                        — basically, checking for updates at regular time 
                        intervals. I found that if I limited myself to one API call per second, I 
                        could mostly avoid 429 errors.
                    </p>

                        My next step was to clean up my code. During the process of adding new 
                        features and trying to fix bugs, I would often “comment out” various 
                        fixes. This allowed me to see what I had tried, what had worked, and 
                        what did not. Now that I had some functioning code, I went through and 
                        deleted unused code, cleaned up existing code, and added explanatory comments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After lunch (a quick stop at Sahara with Sam and Anna, and a tour of 
                        <a href="http://nymbl.healthcare/" title="Nymbl's Website">Nymbl’s</a> 
                        offices), I still had one more problem I wanted to tackle: I was separating 
                        my synth and synth control components, and knew that they wouldn’t have 
                        any common parents to pass state up to. This meant that I need some way 
                        to store my Boolean value for triggering synth sounds. One strategy that 
                        I attempted was using 
                        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" title="React Documentation: Context">React context</a>. 
                        Context allows you to store values outside of the parent-child tree. This 
                        was a new aspect of React to me, so first I had to research this technique, 
                        before then attempting to implement it.
                    </p>

                        After that failed to work, I tried using conditional rendering and then 
                        async functions before finally realizing that I might be able to solve 
                        my problem with a simple line of PHP in the API call. At this point it 
                        was 6pm, and I decided to go home and sleep on the problem.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Tuesday</h3>

                    <p>
                        Overslept my alarm — ended up being late to my workout class :(
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sleeping on my API call problem worked! I got into class this morning and 
                        ended up solving my problem in the first 30 minutes!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I spent most of the day working on getting my visualizer to react to my 
                        synth audio. It would work, but only in very brief flashes. Today 
                        was another fairly frustrating day — as I worked on one problem all 
                        day and found no solutions. I had both Ian and Justin help me, but 
                        since I was using a library (Pts.js) that they weren’t familiar with, 
                        neither of them had much luck. I stayed until 7pm, felt like I made 
                        no progress, and went home feeling a little defeated.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wednesday</h3>
