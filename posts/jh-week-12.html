                        age on paper that is 1/4th of the age you actually feel. :)

                    <p>
                        For the past few weeks, I have been reading 
                        <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/110/1107939/user-friendly/9780753556641.html" title="User Friendly Book Publisher's Page">”User Friendly: How the Hidden Rules of Design Are Changing the Way We Live, Work, and Play”</a> 
                        by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant. Sometimes I think that design 
                        is looked at as the least important of a developer’s skill set. 
                        Backend is typically seen as more complex, and is usually more highly 
                        compensated. Kuang and Fabricant’s book has had me thinking a lot 
                        this month about the importance of design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first thing that I found interesting is the story of 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple, Inc Wikipedia">Apple</a>. 
                        When Apple began its rise to world dominance, I was still too young to be 
                        a heavy computer user. It’s interesting because when I say “too young” 
                        I was actually much older than the age that many children today surf 
                        the web and watch Jake Paul vlogs. The difference is that before Apple 
                        ushered in the age of user friendly devices, children did not use computers 
                        at nearly the rate they do today. Since I was too young to really use a 
                        computer before Apple became prominent, I did not really understand the 
                        context in which Apple began making hardware.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before Apple, computers were powerful machines that required specialized 
                        knowledge to use. They came with large, densely worded manuals, and despite 
                        the fact that they could do many tasks better than old methods, their 
                        difficulty of use prevented them from being nearly as prevalent as they 
                        are today. Apple’s designers strove to create user interfaces that lessened 
                        the difficulty of taking a task from an idea in your head --> to the 
                        interaction with the computer --> to the desired result. The iPhone and 
                        the ability to physically touch and drag objects around the screen really 
                        embodies this ease of use. To move down a page you simply drag down, just 
                        as you would drag a piece of physical paper across a table if you wanted to 
                        move it downward. Apple helped revolutionize the world of intuitive computing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One aspect that “User Friendly” has had me thinking about is the difference between 
                        UI and UX. UI and UX are often grouped together as UI/UX, and it wasn’t until recently 
                        that I started thinking about their differences. UI stands for User Interface, and I 
                        think this is what most people think about when they imagine a designer. UI includes 
                        aspects such as color, layout, and aesthetics. UX stands for User Experience, and may 
                        have very little to do with visual design, but rather with how a human interacts with 
                        an object. UX involves thinking about how a designer can help make using a device as 
                        intuitive as possible. UI and UX can be completely independent of each other. Imagine 
                        you download an app with great UI: the colors are beautiful, there are tons of animations 
                        when you interact with the screen, etc. Now imagine that you start interacting with the 
                        app. You want to move an object from the bottom to the top of the screen. Instinctively, 
                        you click and drag. Nothing happens. Finally, you realize if you tap on the object, a 
                        menu appears. In that menu,  hidden at the bottom of a scrollable list of 20 options, 
                        you finally see “Move”. You tap “Move”, and are taken to a new screen where you are 
                        asked to enter X and Y coordinates for the desired location of the object. Talk about 
                        bad UX. I’m sure you can also imagine a case when an app with minimal User Interface, 
                        could have a great, intuitive User Experience.
                    </p>

                        For more information on UI and UX, I recommend reading

                        or to check out some of Apple’s documentation on 
                        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/" title="Apple's Human Interface Guidelines">Human Design Interface Guidelines</a>.
