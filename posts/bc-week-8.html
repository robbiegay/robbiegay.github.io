                        On Monday we worked remote. President Trump held a last minute 
                        rally for the Kentucky Republicans and there was concern about 
                        traffic being congested. On Tuesday, Kentucky 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear#Governor_of_Kentucky" title="Andy Beshear Wikipedia">elected a new governor</a> 
                        and UK opened their basketball season by defeating #1 Michigan State.

                        Awesome Inc takes ping pong pretty seriously. There is a tournament every year, and 
                        several Inc-ers are highly skilled. I’m trying to get better but still manage to 
                        lose just about every match I play. We played some round robin ping pong this week. 
                        You have to volley and then run around the table to return the shot.

                        On Thursday, our informal Bootcamp Lunch Club™ ate at 
                        <a href="https://www.sunrisebakeryky.com/" title="Sunrise Bakery Website">Sunrise Bakery</a>. 
                        They have a cool “make me a sandwich” option, so we all took our chances 
                        with mystery sandwiches. On Friday we had Bootcamp Happy Hour! About 2/3<sup>rds</sup> 
                        of our class met up at <a href="http://marikkaslex.com/" title="Marikka's Website">Marikka’s</a> 
                        for drinks and games. Below is a picture of 
                        Abram beating Taylor and I two-on-one in foosball. On Saturday, Anna and I 
                        went to Sahara. Ethan has been telling me how good their food is all semester. I was 
                        really impressed — their garlic sauce is awesome!

                    <p>
                        Last week we continued working on learning Laravel. 
                        I worked through the remaining 
                        <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch" title="Laravel 6 from Scratch">Laracast Videos</a> 
                        and then began working on the 
                        <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/react-restaurant/" title="Laravel Library GitHub Repo">Laravel Library project</a>. 
                        This is the first time that the instructors have assigned this 
                        project, and apparently they didn’t think we could 
                        get it done in the allotted 3 days. On Thursday,  
                        6 of us stuck around the classroom until 8 or 9 pm to 
                        finish in time for Friday Demo Day. There might have 
                        even been a blood oath to not leave until the project 
                        was completed…
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I had a lot of fun working on the Laravel Library. I learn 
                        more by doing and after following along with the Laracast Videos 
                        for several days, I was really ready to jump in and start coding! 
                        This project has made me realize that I like Back End. I really enjoy 
                        the problem solving aspect of Back End programming, and found using 
                        <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/30" title="Laracast Video on foreign keys">foreign keys</a> 
                        to link items between tables really neat. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Thursday we wrapped up the 
                        <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" title="HackerRank Website">HackerRank</a> 
                        morning warm-ups &#128533;. I have really enjoyed starting the day with some fast 
                        paced problem solving. Although we now get an extra hour to work on our various projects, 
                        I will miss starting the day like this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are officially 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of the way through the Bootcamp! On one hand, it seems 
                        like the time has absolutely flown by. I was a little worried that 16 weeks of daily 
                        programming was going to be hard to get through, but now I can’t believe that it’s 
                        almost over! It’s also hard to believe that in July I knew nothing about programming, 
                        and now I feel comfortable with a (small) laundry list of languages and frameworks: 
                        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, PHP, MySQL, Laravel…
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Upon completion of the Bootcamp, I hope to continue refining my knowledge portfolio. 
                        I obviously think that I will learn a great deal at whatever job I land at, but I 
                        also hope to use a 30-60-90 day plan to augment that learning with some work on my 
                        own. A 30-60-90 day plan involves determining what you should be working on now 
                        (your 30-day goal), what you plan on working on next (60-day goal), as well as 
                        looking to the future, and brainstorming what might be on the horizon (90-day goal). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m looking forward to this final stretch of the Bootcamp. Although I don’t actually 
                        want it to be over, I am really excited to find a job and starting work as a web developer!
                    </p>

                        This week I learned that I write my alphabet backwards. This is news to me. I had 
                        never paid any attention to how I write letters, and I had assumed that others 
                        write their letters in a similar manner. Midweek, some fellow Bootcampers saw 
                        me writing on the white board, and commented that something seemed a little off. 
                        I ended up writing out the entire alphabet (thankfully I still remember the song). 
                        Apparently my e’s are the worst offender.
