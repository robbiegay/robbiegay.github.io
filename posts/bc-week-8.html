                        On Monday, we worked remote. President Trump held 
                        a last minute rally for Kentucky’s Republicans on 
                        Monday night, and there were reports of multiple road 
                        closures. I really enjoyed working from home! The best 
                        part was probably my midday nap (something that unintentionally 
                        stretched to 2 and a half hours). This was nice, as I was 
                        refreshed and able to better absorb our 
                        <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch" title="Laravel 6 From Scratch">Laracast videos</a>. 
                        Thankfully, I was able to make up for this lost time 
                        by working well into the evening.

                        Tuesday was both election day and the start of the UK 
                        basketball season! Republicans swept the state in 
                        all offices except governor, where Andy Beshear beat 
                        incumbent Matt Bevin by roughly 5,000 votes. I had a 
                        lot of fun watching the results trickle in. When it was 
                        down to the wire, I pulled up historical voting data on 
                        the remaining 16 precincts and was trying to predict 
                        which way the needle would fall based on voter turnout 
                        in the 2015 election!

                        UK opened its season against #1 Michigan State. The Cats 
                        held on for a victory, and are excepted to move from a #2 to a 
                        #1 early next week! With each rotating batch of talent, 
                        I like to pick a few players to root for. So far I’m a big fan of 
                        <a href="https://ukathletics.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=7521">Tyrese Maxey</a> 
                        and <a href="https://ukathletics.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=7515">Nate Sestina</a>.

                        This week our Bootcamp learned that I write my alphabet in a weird manner. 
                        This is news to me. I had no idea <b>how</b> I wrote the letter “e” until 
                        asked to do so in front of the class. I still think that I am just ahead 
                        of the curve on this one — maybe one day everyone will catch up and starting 
                        writing their "e"’s from the bottom!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, on Friday we had a happy hour for out Bootcamp cohort! We all met up at 
                        <a href="http://marikkaslex.com/">Marikka’s</a> around 5:30. We had a pretty good 
                        turnout with over half of the class showing up! Lots of games were played. I’ve 
                        included a picture of 
                        <a href="https://taylorakin.github.io/" title="Taylor's Blog">Taylor</a> and I losing 
                        a 2 against 1 Foosball match against 
                        <a href="https://wildercat.github.io/" title="Abram's Blog">Abram</a>. I was really glad 
                        that so many of the cohort came out!
