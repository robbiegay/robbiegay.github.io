            <p>
                I’m writing this late on a Labor Day Monday night. My 
                girlfriend is currently in flight back from NYC where 
                she saw a Jonas Brother Concert (not super jealous), 
                and ate at a Michelin Starred Chinese restaurant 
                (<strong>super</strong> jealous). My Labor Day Weekend 
                was <em>pretty</em> good (thanks for asking) — I spent 
                a decent amount of time reading and reviewing HTML and 
                CSS but did manage to stop by my neighbor’s new pool 
                each of the 3 holiday weekend days!

                This weekend wraps up the second week of Coding Bootcamp 
                Prework. The focus of this week was an introduction to HTML 
                and CSS. HTML stands for hypertext markup language. HTML is 
                not a coding language (it’s a markup language), although if 
                you looked at a page of HTML, you might be fooled.
            </p>

                <figcaption>not code, don't get fooled</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                CSS stands for cascading style sheets. HTML provides the 
                structure of your webpage and CSS gives it it’s style. HTML 
                is like the frame of your house, CSS is the doors, windows, 
                paint, etc:

            <p>
                We covered a range of basic HTML and CSS topics, and although 
                I would love to write a post covering <em>everything</em> we 
                learned, I would also love to go to sleep at some point. 
                Instead, here is a very basic introduction to HTML/CSS!
            </p>

            <!--|| HTML Intro -->

            <h2>HTML: A very basic introduction</h2>

            <p>
                The basic building block of HTML is the element. An element 
                is declared using opening (<element>) and closing (</element>) 
                tags. Between said tags, lies the content of the element.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                The above example uses the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. “p” 
                stands for paragraph. A paragraph is the basic holding element 
                for the body of your text. The text you are reading now is 
                contained within a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. You can find 
                a whole list of other tags on the 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" 
                    title="MDN HTML Reference">documentation site</a>.
            </p>

                <figcaption>The HTML of the above paragraph</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Elements are nested within a hierarchy in HTML. Below is a 
                very basic layout for a HTML webpage:
            </p>

            <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/img/html-example.png" 
                        alt="An image of some basic HTML">
                    <figcaption>Here is an example of basic HTML</figcaption>
                </figure>
            
            <p>
                A rundown of what is going on here:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> this declares to 
                        the muses of the internet that the below information 
                        is a HTML document, and to process that information 
                        accordingly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> This is the opening tag that 
                        begins the actual HTML document. Notice at the bottom 
                        of our markup is <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> this 
                        closes the markup. This level is sometimes called the 
                        root. 
                    </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Although not required, I have also declared 
                                the language (“lang”) of our webpage: it is 
                                written in English (“en”), the US dialect.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> The head contains the 
                        elements that the end user does not need to see, 
                        but that the machines find useful. 
                    </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Here we have a metadata tag “meta” that 
                                declares the charset (set of characters 
                                that the browser can interpret). Here we 
                                have defined it as utf-8, which allows us 
                                to use virtually all 1.1 million characters 
                                and symbols in any world language. You can 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" 
                                    title="utf-8 Wikipedia Page">
                                    read more about utf-8 here</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> This is the title 
                                of the webpage. It is useful for search 
                                engines (it is the name that appears in big 
                                title letters in search results). It also 
                                appears as the title of the window or tab 
                                when on the site. Additionally, it is the 
                                default name when you try to bookmark the 
                                page (for example, bookmarking this 
                                <em>awesome</em> blog would give you 
                                the default title "Prework Week 2")
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> notice that we 
                                then close the head with a closing tag.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>
                        &lt;body&gt; The body is where the main content of our 
                        webpage lives. The only content that we have here is 
                        “hello world” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" 
                            title="'Hello, world!' Wikipedia Page">
                            click for context about the hello world convention</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We then close out our <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and 
                        close out our <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Notice how the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> opening and closing tags 
                are on the same line, but the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags 
                are on different lines (and indentations)? Whitespace, or the 
                spacing of the HTML document, doesn’t matter to the web 
                browser. We could put everything on one line! Rather, it 
                matters to us. Laying things out in a human-readable manner 
                is handy for anyone working with computers. 
                <br><br>
                Here is the end result of our HTML. Things will look a little sparse, but we did a good job setting up a basic layout:
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../assets/img/html-result.png" 
                    alt="An image of our test website">
                <figcaption>This is what our test website looks like!</figcaption>
                </figure>

            <!--|| CSS Intro -->

            <h2>CSS: Another brief introduction</h2>

            <p>
                We can add CSS to our example HTML to give it some style!
                <br><br>
                First, we need to link our CSS file in the HTML markup, so 
                that the web browser knows where to find it. If we don’t tell 
                the computer where to look, it would be like telling a human, 
                “fetch me a glass of water”. Your friend might not know where 
                you keep you cups. Linking to the stylesheet is like saying 
                “fetch me a glass of water, the glasses are in the cabinet 
                next to the fridge.”                    
            </p>

            <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/img/html-add-stylesheet.png" 
                        alt="An image showing how to link to a CSS Stylesheet">
                    <figcaption>Linking to a CSS Stylesheet</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                CSS is formatted a little different than HTML.  A CSS rule or 
                ruleset tells the browser how to style various HTML elements. 
                On the left, are the selectors, these tell HTML which part of 
                the page to apply the style rule to. 
            </p>

            <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/img/" alt="">
                    <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                A CSS example might look like:
                <br><br>
                <code>.robbie {color: purple}</code>
                <br><br>
                In computer speak, this takes the class “<code>robbie</code>” 
                (an endstop “<code>.</code>” before a word makes it apply to a 
                whole class of elements), and turns it/him purple. In human 
                speak the selector <code>.robbie</code> would sound like “make 
                robbie…” and the declaration <code>{color: purple}</code> 
                would sound like “…become purple colored”.
                <br><br>
                A final example of CSS will be to apply it to the example HTML we used before.
                <br><br>
                <code><pre>
                    p {
                        color: lightsalmon;
                        border: 1px dotted green
                    }
                </pre></code>
                <br><br>
                We have told the web browser to make all &lt;p&gt; elements 
                the color “<code>lightsalmon</code>” and to add a 
                "<code>1px</code>" (pixel) wide, dotted, green-colored border 
                around them.  
            </p>
