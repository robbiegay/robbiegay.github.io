                I’m writing this late on a Labor Day Monday night. My 
                girlfriend is currently in flight back from NYC where 
                she saw a Jonas Brother Concert (not super jealous), 
                and ate at a Michelin Starred Chinese restaurant 
                (<strong>super</strong> jealous). My Labor Day Weekend 
                <em>was</em> pretty good (thanks for asking) — I spent 
                a decent amount of time reading and reviewing HTML and 
                CSS but did manage to at least stop by my neighbor’s new 
                pool each of the 3 long-weekend days — bringing my total 
                summer pool count up to 4!

                This weekend wraps up the second week of Coding Bootcamp 
                Prework. The focus of this week was an introduction to 
                HTML and CSS. HTML stands for hypertext markup language, 
                it’s not a coding language (it’s a markup language), 
                although if you looked at a page of html, you might be fooled
            </p>

                CSS stands for cascading style sheets. HTML provides 
                the structure of your webpage and CSS gives it it’s style. 
                Here’s a great image I found comparing the two:

                We covered a range of basic html and css topics, and 
                although I would love to write a post covering <em>everything</em> 
                we learned, I would also love to go to sleep at some point. So 
                instead, here is a very basic introduction to HTML/CSS!
