                    <h3 class="text-center">The Job Hunt</h3>

                    <p>
                        Around Jan 15th, I started doing freelance iOS development for 
                        <a href="https://warnerdesigntechnology.com/" title="Tommy's website">Tommy Warner</a>. 
                        Tommy previously worked as a physics teacher at Lafayette for 6 years, during which 
                        time he taught himself to write software and started taking on clients through 
                        <a href="https://www.upwork.com/" title="UpWork's website">UpWork</a>. 
                        After this past school year, Tommy was able to step away from teaching and pursue 
                        freelancing fulltime. Tommy told me that he had gotten to the point where he 
                        was having to turn away clients because he was too busy to take on new work, 
                        and was therefore hoping to hire someone part time to help write some 
                        <a href="https://swift.org/" title="Swift documentation">Swift</a> code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Switching gears from web to mobile development presented some challenges. 
                        During the Bootcamp, we slowly ramped up from the most basic to more advanced 
                        apps. This meant that I usually got a fairly solid grip on a concept before 
                        adding something new. While working for Tommy, I had to jump into already 
                        built projects, and felt as though I was confused as to what was going on 
                        outside of the small scope of my current project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To help remedy this, I spent some time last weekend and this week, reading 
                        through the Swift documentation and taking notes. In addition to notes, 
                        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" title="Xcode website">Xcode</a> 
                        has a cool playground feature that allows you to write code and see 
                        instant results — this allowed me to apply new concepts that I was learning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This past week I built my first personal app, a calculator! I was really excited 
                        to build something that I could run on my phone. While web development seemed 
                        challenging, there are online website builders and it didn’t see impossible 
                        to build your own website, even prior to the Bootcamp. App development, 
                        however, had a certain magical quality, and I was really excited to build 
                        something that I could run on my phone.
                    </p>

                    <!-- CALC PICS AND GIFS -->

                    <p>
                        We built a calculator in the Bootcamp, so this project mostly involved 
                        refactoring my code over from JavaScript to Swift. Even so, there were 
                        some problems (mostly WET code) that I was able to address on this build. 
                        I was also pretty happy with the retro color scheme. And since almost everyone 
                        has a calculator on their phone, I added an Easter Egg — Party Mode — that can 
                        be accessed by inputting my birthday: “32193”.
