            Happy super ~spooky~ Friday the 13th!! This week was our final 
            week of Bootcamp Prework and it really seemed like these last four 
            weeks just flew by!
        </p>
        <p>
            I was a little nervous going into the Prework phase. I wasn’t 
            really sure what to expect: Would the workload or complexity of 
            the material be too much to handle? Would I realize, once I had 
            become more immersed in coding, that it wasn’t really for me? 
            Thankfully I found neither of these to be the case — The course 
            material during Prework was challenging but exciting, and I’ve had a 
            lot more fun than I excepted to writing code!
        </p>
        <h3>Prework Week 4</h3>
        <p>
            This week was lighter on the readings, and started to skew more 
            towards project-based work. We started with another 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks" 
            title="JavaScript Building Blocks">MDN module</a>, this one 
            introducing us to some more JavaScript building blocks —  things 
            like loops, functions, return values, and events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we moved on to four coding projects. Our first project still 
            involved a little bit of handholding. For the 
            <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/image-gallery/" title="Image Gallery">Image Gallery</a>, 
            we were given some starter code, as well as instructions on what 
            parts of the code we still needed to fill in. After the Image 
            Gallery project, however, we were on our own.
        </p>
        <p>
            My biggest takeaway from this week's assignments has been that I 
            have become a pretty big Pseudo Code enthusiast! For the 
            <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/countdown-timer/" 
            title="Countdown Timer">Countdown Timer</a> assignment, I felt 
            like I had an idea of how the code could work pretty early on. I 
            <em>did</em> jot down a rough outline of the code, but didn’t 
            bother to mentally run through the various steps of my proposed 
            coding plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then jumped right into writing the code, and several hours later, I 
            was approaching something that resembled a Countdown Timer. 
            It was only when I was trying to work in some final bits of 
            functionality, that I realized that my initial approach was 
            fatally flawed. Had I used Pseudo Code to work through the logical 
            flow of my program <strong>before</strong> I started writing 
            code, then I likely would have realized some of these late-stage 
            mistakes early on. Instead, I ended up having to rewrite a lot of 
            my code, costing me several additional hours. Starting with Pseudo 
            Code would likely have saved me both time and headaches

        <h3>Reflection: The Prework Period</h3>
        <p>
            Each week of Prework presented different challenges and opportunities. 
            <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/posts/pw-week-1.html" 
            title="PW Week 1 Blog Post">Week 1</a> introduced us to Git, Github, 
            and Command Line. A lot of these new technologies felt very 
            confusing at first. After 4 weeks of (nearly) daily practice, I 
            think I am starting to feel more comfortable... at least with the 
            basics.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/posts/pw-week-2.html" 
            title="PW Week 2 Blog Post">Week 2</a> introduced us to HTML and 
            CSS, and saw us creating our first blog posts! I found the 
            structuring of HTML to be fairly straightforward. Conversely, I 
            really struggled with getting CSS to work. It was challenging to 
            try to understand the various parent/child relationships between 
            the different elements, or to figure out how different properties got 
            inherited or overwritten. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect 
            though, was finally getting your webpage looking how you want 
            it to, only to realize that, if viewed on anything other than 
            a browser window of <strong>exactly the same size</strong>, 
            that things weren't going to look anything close to how you 
            laid them out.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/posts/pw-week-3.html" 
            title="PW Week 3 Blog Post">Week 3</a> introduced us to 
            JavaScript, while Week 4 added some more fundamentals 
            to our knowledge portfolio. Most of the challenges of working with 
            JavaScript involved coping with the various highs and lows of 
            creative problem solving. First came the high of the eureka moment when you  
            became <strong>convinced</strong> of a solution to your current 
            problem. Then, the low of this solution only managing to break 
            what you had working before. One thing that helped was to not 
            immediately wad your new idea up and throw it in the trash. 
            I found that many times, pausing to comb through your code for 
            syntax errors could be really helpful — as maybe your new solution 
            <em>might</em> actually work if you hadn’t misspelled a variable 
            or left out a bracket.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing that I found really helpful was occasionally closing 
            my computer. For one, just taking breaks and maybe mulling over a 
            problem while you took a walk could often leave to breakthroughs, 
            to thinking, "why hadn't I thought of that yet". And second, I 
            found that beginning your code with just pen and paper was a really helpful 
            way to start. By forcing myself to slow down, to work through ALL 
            the steps of the problem, and to chart out ALL the functionalities 
            I would need, would often lead to developing a better roadmap and 
            better code. I was then able, still with 
            pen and paper, to start solving these problems and adding 
            various functionalities. This made the act of writing the code 
            a little bit like filling in the blanks.

        <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
           I am <strong>super</strong> excited to start Bootcamp Week 1 on Monday!

        <p>
            I felt like we learned a lot more than I expected to in this 
            introductory period, and I am really stoked to see what we 
            will be learning in our first few weeks of Bootcamp!
