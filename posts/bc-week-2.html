                    <p>
                        Bootcamp Week 2 was mostly project based. I worked on
                        three projects this week: a Weather App, a Tic-Tac-Toe
                        game, and a Calculator. Each of these projects was built
                        using JavaScript, and each helped introduce us to some
                        new aspect of the language.
                    </p>

                    <h3>This Week’s Projects</h3>

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/weather-app/" title="My Weather App">The Weather App</a> 
                        was designed to take a user-inputted zip-code, and output 
                        real-time weather conditions for that area. This project 
                        introduced us to APIs and JSON. APIs are Application 
                        Programming Interfaces, sets of code governing access 
                        points to a servers or databases. JSON stands for JavaScript 
                        Object Notation, and is a standardized data format. We used the 
                        <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" title="openweathermap API">openweathermap API</a> 
                        for this project, and received data from that API in the JSON format. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/tic-tac-toe/" title="My Tic-Tac-Toe game">Tic-Tac-Toe game</a> 
                        involved testing a set of 8 win conditions against the 
                        current X and O positions on the Tic-Tac-Toe board. 
                        To solve this, I created a nested array with the various 
                        win conditions, and tested them against the current state 
                        of the board (also in an array). This test was run upon 
                        each firing of the click event handler.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/calculator/" title="My Calculator App">Calculator</a> 
                        project involved building a basic calculator that could use
                         +, -, /, x on user-inputted numbers. This project seemed pretty 
                         straight forward at first — computers should be pretty good 
                         at adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying. The problem, 
                         however, lay in the fact that there are a multitude of 
                         combinations for which the user could input values. What 
                         happens if the user presses:  + 5 6 - / 3 =? Should the computer 
                         ignore the opening two operands? 5 and 6 pressed sequentially 
                         should obviously form “56”. And what about the “- /“? Should 
                         the computer ignore the first operand in this case as well?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were many edge cases, and on my first attempt at creating 
                        the calculator, I tried to solve all of these scenarios from 
                        the beginning. This resulted in a somewhat functioning calculator, 
                        but at the expense of running some very convoluted code behind 
                        the scenes. I decided to start fresh and create a second JS sheet, 
                        and to focus on just solving core problems first. After I had 
                        some fairly clean code that worked well, I then began to 
                        incrementally add edge case solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, the Calculator was my first time dynamically 
                        rendering an application in JavaScript. The body of my HTML 
                        document only contains a single &lt;div&gt; element for the 
                        JavaScript to build the app on.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>

                    <p>
                        My biggest take away from Bootcamp Week 2 was that I started 
                        to think about and establish a personal development process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My first step is to read over the project parameters, and to 
                        Pseudo Code the problem. I will draw out the potential UI, 
                        thinking about how various elements will scale at different 
                        screen sizes, as well as what elements are clickable and how 
                        various elements should interact. I will also work on the 
                        code as well — mapping out ideas relating to how I think 
                        the problem could be solved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I will then usually go ahead and build my UI. This gives me 
                        something to work with and test code on. If you need to 
                        test what happens when a button gets pressed, it’s pretty 
                        hard to do so if you haven’t built any buttons!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My next step is to build the core functionality of the project. 
                        This MVP will fulfill the broad requirements for functionality, 
                        while leaving edge cases to a latter step. Throughout this 
                        process, I will likely come up with ideas for new features, 
                        or think of possible edge case problems. In order to not get 
                        sidetracked, I will jot down these ideas on a pad of paper.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once I get the core functionality working, I will then begin 
                        solving for edge cases. <a href="http://ianrios.me/" title="Ian's Website">Ian</a> 
                        recommended that I prioritize edge cases by using a four-quadrant 
                        grid. The grid compares Important and Non-Important vs. 
                        Urgent and Less-Urgent. This allowed me to tackle edge 
                        cases with a certain hierarchy.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="figure">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="" alt="">
                        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Caption</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Working within this developmental framework helped me 
                        write more efficient code, in a more timely manner!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>

                    <p>
                        In Bootcamp Week 3, we will be tackling a 
                        <a href="https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Projects-Exercises/blob/master/docs/projects/sliding-puzzle.md" title="Sliding Puzzle Project Prompt">Sliding Puzzle project</a> 
                        — involving moving pieces around a board each 
                        time a user clicks. This project seems pretty 
                        intimidating right now, but I believe that we 
                        will be learning some new concepts that will 
                        greatly help with this project!
                    </p>
