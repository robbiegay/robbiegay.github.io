                    <p>
                        We are officially into the second half of the Bootcamp. 
                        This week we began working with Back End programming — 
                        but first — a weekly update!
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Weekly Update</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anna and I made plans to grab lunch on Thursday. As soon 
                        as I hopped in her car, we saw a group of Bootcampers coming 
                        out of Awesome Inc, clearly deliberating on where to eat. 
                        Anna had said that she wanted to meet some more of my classmates, 
                        so I hopped out and invited everyone to join us!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We went over to 
                        <a href="https://wineandmarket.com/" title="Wine and Market's Website">Wine and Market</a>, 
                        a really cool sandwich spot and boutique grocery store over on 
                        Jefferson Street. I always feel like I’m in the hot seat when 
                        showing a new food spot to others but everyone seemed to enjoy 
                        it! I personally think their #9 — a turkey, strawberry rhubarb 
                        preserve, and goat cheese on ciabatta bread — is one of the best 
                        sandwiches in Lex.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Thursday, Awesome Inc held a fun little Halloween celebration! 
                        There was a caramel apple bar as well as some pumpkin decorating. 
                        It was a lot of fun — can you guess which pumpkin was mine?
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            On Friday, the UK Men’s Basketball team played their second exhibition 
                            game against Kentucky State. Anna and I had 2 extra tickets, so 
                            I offered them up to anyone in the Bootcamp and 
                            <a href="http://ianrios.me/" title="Ian's Website">Ian</a> was the 
                            first to claim them. Ian and his wife Olivia joined us for dinner 
                            at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sawyers-Downtown-Bar-Grill-491414770920862/" title="Sawyer's Facebook Page">Sawyer's</a> 
                            before the game. I’m starting to get a little ‘foodie’-ish with all 
                            of these recommendation, but I do think that the chili and burgers at Sawyer's are the 
                            best in town. We sat in our actual seats (upper arena) for the first 
                            half, but took our chances in the second half by 
                            snagging some open seats about 8 rows from the floor. Luckily no one 
                            kicked us out, and we were a lot closer to the action! Additionally, during halftime we 
                            got some very yummy Rupp Arena ice cream. &#128525;

                        <p>
                            This week we started learning Back End development! We began by 
                            learning some 
                            <a href="https://www.php.net/" title="PHP Documentation Site">PHP</a>. 
                            PHP stands for ‘PHP: Hypertext Processor’, which is a recursive acronym, 
                            apparently something that programmers love. We built a practice server, 
                            and attempted to build an API that could pull data from that server. 
                            I might have went a little bit overboard when I decided to add 1,000,000 
                            items to my nonsense database…
                        </p>

                        <figure class="figure">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/million-item-db.png" alt="My example database">
                            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">1 million food items</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            About midweek, we jumped into 
                            <a href="https://laravel.com/" title="The Laravel Website">Laravel</a>. 
                            Laravel is a PHP framework that is billed as an elegant and 
                            expressive means to do Back End programming. I have really 
                            enjoyed learning Laravel so far. We have been working our 
                            way through this 
                            "<a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch" title="Laracasts">Laravel 6 From Scratch</a>" 
                            video series. I find it to be a pretty fun way to learn! 
                            I follow along with the video, pausing it to apply what 
                            I just learned to my own code. Once I feel like I 
                            have come to an understanding about some topic, I then try to 
                            summarize it in my notes.

                            Around chapter 3 of the Laracast series, my comprehension 
                            level started to drop. I found the same thing happening 
                            with several of our recent learning endeavors (React, PHP). I 
                            will make a decent amount of progress, but then the wave of 
                            confusion washes over me and I have to swim back to shore. 
                            A solution that I have found is to go ahead and skim over 
                            the remaining material. I don’t stress about the fact that 
                            I am not entirely following along. Rather, I am trying to 
                            get a broad picture, to see how the pieces fit together. 
                            I then go back and read (or watch) the material again. 
                            When I started getting lost in the Laracasts, I turned 
                            the playback speed to 2x and powered through the remaining videos. This 
                            allowed me to get a broad overview of many of the cool Laravel features.

                            One thing that I have been struggling with is getting enough 
                            sleep. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not falling asleep in class, 
                            but when learning new material, I find that even a little 
                            bit of extra fatigue really hinders my ability to learn 
                            new concepts. My goal for next week, is to go to bed an 
                            hour earlier! That plan sounds great, except that I had 
                            the same goal last week. Oh well.
                        </p>

                            I slept in both Saturday and Sunday mornings, and then started 
                            rewatching the Laracasts. I found this really helpful — I 
                            was fresh and alert, and was able to absorb the material 
                            really well. I am really starting to see how useful Laravel 
                            is. Right now, its only hindrance is that it is 
                            so full of features that it can be a little difficult to 
                            understand at first. While working with JavaScript, I would 
                            create one or two JS files, an HTML file, and a CSS file. 
                            When I run <code>Laravel new project name</code>, it makes 
                            a massive amount of files. I just went through and tried to count 
                            how many files this actually does create. I was around 140~ 
                            when I got into the vendor bin and realized that it 
                            would be a waste of time to keep counting. This is obviously 
                            a great thing — look how much functionality comes built in 
                            to Laravel. It does mean, however, that the learning curve is a little 
                            bit steep, and a fair bit intimidating. I look forward to a 
                            time when I can make better use of some of these powerful features!

                            Next week we start the week of with a remote day! 
                            <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump" title="The Donald's Twitter Page">President Trump</a> 
                            is holing a political rally in the evening, and most of 
                            downtown will be blocked off starting at 2pm. Traffic 
                            will be a nightmare, and because of this we will be working 
                            from home. We will spend the first day or two working through 
                            the rest of the Laracasts, and will then move into the 
                            <a href="https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Projects-Exercises/blob/master/docs/projects/laravel-library.md" title="Project Prompt">Laravel Library</a> 
                            project. Tuesday is election day. I’m looking forward to voting, 
                            and will be excited to see how the election plays out across 
                            the state. Finally, on Tuesday night (9:30pm — remember 
                            my earlier goal about bedtimes?) #2 UK faces off against 
                            #1 Michigan State. I’m very excited for the game — hopefully 
                            it won't be a repeat of last years UK – Duke matchup!
