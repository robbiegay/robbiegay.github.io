                        Demo day! After 4 weeks of prework and 12 weeks of full-time Bootcamp,
                        everything culminated in the presentation of our final projects on Demo Day!

                    <h3>Final Days of Coding</h3>

                    <p>
                        Monday and Tuesday were our final days of coding. The stress levels in the room seemed
                        noticeably lower than at the end of week 11. At the end of week 11, many of us were still trying
                        to implement new stories, and the time crunch was bearing down on us. By Monday of week 12, if
                        we had not yet started a new story, it was likely that that story would now be pushed to a future
                        sprint. We were now in the process of polishing up our code and making small improvements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most of my major stories got wrapped up the previous Friday. The final major story that I was
                        attempting to implement was a timer function to kick inactive users out of the queue. I got 
                        about halfway done Monday evening before determining that this was unlikely to get done this
                        sprint, and added it to my features list for next sprint!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Tuesday, I set about tackling my Google Cloud hosting problem. For some reason, Google Cloud
                        did not like the fact that I used both React and Laravel in one project file. After attempting to
                        debug this with both Justin and Ian, and with time now running dangerously low, I decided that this
                        build would have to be run locally, and went about the process of hosting my app from my IP address. 
                        Once I got my site hosted locally 
                        (I implemented it fully sometime Tuesday afternoon), I spent my remaining time testing for bugs
                        and bringing my code up to production standards.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Demo Day Prep</h3>

                    <p>
                        Our code freeze was at 10:30am Wednesday morning. Now that I had a demo-able project, I set about
                        writing a blog post for the week and a <a>README</a> for MPM<sup>2</sup>. I then began
                        drafting my speech for our two-minute introduction presentations. We did several rehearsals — and 
                        critiques — on Wednesday, and a final dress rehearsal on Thursday morning.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Demo Day</h3>

                    <p>
                        Around 10am, we went down and began setting up our booths. I borrowed some external speakers to
                        play my
                        synth sounds, and set up an external monitor for the visuals. I found that, although the app
                        worked locally
                        and could be run on a user's phone, it was much more stable on desktop versions. As such, Ian
                        offered to let
                        me use his laptop to demo the user experience. On Ian's laptop, users could control the various 
                        synth and visual parameters. On my laptop, I had the source code and MySQL database, as
                        well as my blog
                        and LinkedIn pages available for users to peruse. I also set up a contact sheet, laid out some resumes, and
                        posted my name on the table!
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Around 11:30am, the guests started to arrive! We then mingled and talked with friends and family
                        for
                        about 30 minutes. Waiting was making me a little anxious, so I was glad when the instructors
                        began
                        their presentations around noon. Nick, Justin, and Ian all talked about the Bootcamp and 
                        our final project development process. After they were done speaking, we each had two minutes to
                        introduce ourselves and to talk about our projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For my presentation, I talked about my background in 
                        <a href="spotify:album:3izLLRwlc66KiLs3M6P4wk" title="My single 'Wake'">music making</a>, my intention of
                        combining this passion with our tech stack for the final project, and finally how
                        MPM<sup>2</sup> worked.
                        I even had two jokes planned for my speech — one about how I cut off all my long hair, and
                        another about
                        the value of my project (none — it's art). They were both received well — but don't worry, no
                        plans to
                        go into stand up comedy anytime soon.

                        After presenting, we had about an hour of open booths. I got to showcase MPM<sup>2</sup> to
                        several groups of people, and many of them managed to make some rather interesting sounds and visuals! 
                        It was really fun getting to talk about a project that had consumed so much of my time for the last 3 weeks. 
                        I also got some really interesting feedback and advice on where to take the project next!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Post Demo Day</h3>

                    <p>
                        After Demo Day wrapped up, we all went across the street to
                        <a href="https://www.eastendtapandtable.com/" title="EE T&T Website">East End Tap and Table</a>
                        for a celebratory meal. Still staying true to my new Pescetarian lifestyle, I ordered the
                        tofu siam-wich. It was really good!
                    </p>

                        It feels a little strange that the Bootcamp is over. At the start, 16 weeks seemed
                        like a really long time — yet it mostly flew by. I really enjoyed the projects we
                        worked on, and the occasional ping pong or melee match definitely added to the overall fun. I'm
                        really excited to continue updating this blog, and to keep you in the loop as I kick my job hunt
                        into high gear!
