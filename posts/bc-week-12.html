                        Demo day! After 4 weeks of prework and 12 weeks of full-time Bootcamp, 
                        everything culminated in the presentation of our final projects!

                    <h3>Final Days of Coding</h3>

                    <p>
                        Monday and Tuesday were our final days of coding. The stress levels in the room seemed 
                        noticeably lower than at the end of week 11. At the end of week 11, many of us were still trying 
                        to implement new stories, and the time crunch was bearing down on us. By Monday of week 12, if we had 
                        not yet started a new story, it was likely that that story would now be pushed to a future sprint. 
                        We were now at the point of polishing up our code and making small improvements. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most of my major stories got wrapped up the previous Friday. The final major story that I was 
                        attempting to implement was a timer function to kick inactive users out of the queue. I got this 
                        about halfway done Monday evening before determining that this was unlikely to get done this sprint, 
                        and added it to my features list for next sprint.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Tuesday, I set about tackling my Google Cloud hosting problem. For some reason, Google Cloud 
                        did not seem to like my use of both React and Laravel in one project file. After attempting to debug 
                        this with both Justin and Ian, and with time now running dangerously short, I decided that this build 
                        would have to be run locally, and went about to process of hosting my app locally. Once I got local hosting working 
                        (I implemented it fully sometime Tuesday afternoon), I spent my remaining time testing for bugs and cleaning 
                        my code up to production standards.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Demo Day Prep</h3>

                    <p>
                        Our code freeze was at 10:30am Wednesday morning. Now that I had a demoable program, I set about 
                        writing a blog post draft for the week and a <a>README</a> for MPM<sup>2</sup>. I then began drafting my speech for our 
                        two-minute introduction presentations. We did several rehearsals — and critiques — on Wednesday, and a 
                        final dress rehearsal on Thursday morning.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Demo Day</h3>

                    <p>
                        Around 10am, we went down and began setting up our booths. I borrowed some external speakers to play my 
                        synth sounds, and set up an external monitor for the visuals. I found that, although the app worked locally 
                        and could be run on a user's phone, it was much more stable on desktop versions. As such, Ian offered to let 
                        me use his laptop to demo the user experience. On my laptop, I had the source code, database, as well as my blog 
                        and LinkedIn pages all pulled up. I also set up a contact sheet, laid out some resumes, and posted my name on the table!
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Around 11:30am, the guests started to arrive, and we mingled and talked with friends and family for 
                        about 30 minutes. Waiting was making me a little anxious, so I was glad when the instructors began 
                        their presentations around noon. Nick, Justin, and Ian all talked about the Bootcamp and about our the 
                        Final Project development process. After they got done speaking, we each had two minutes to introduce 
                        ourselves and talk about our projects. 
                    </p>
