        <p>
            I’m writing this on a Saturday — we’ve just wrapped up our third 
            week of Bootcamp Prework, and are barreling full steam ahead 
            towards the final work of remote learning. Starting on Sept. 
            16<sup>th</sup>, we will be reporting in to Awesome Inc., meeting 
            Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm for 12 weeks. I’m very excited, but maybe 
            also a little nervous.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week involved diving a little deeper into HTML and CSS, while 
            also serving as an introduction to JavaScript. Additionally, we 
            did our first Demo Day on Friday! As we are working remotely, this 
            was done via group video chat. We all took turns demonstrating the 
            functionality of our Silly Story Generators, as well as looking 
            under the hood and showcasing/explaining the source code behind 
            our projects.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a coding language that is used on both the client 
            and server sides. On the client side, it is used to add reactive 
            elements to a website. JavaScript <strong>IS NOT</strong> the same 
            as the similarly popular programing language, Java. In fact, the 
            only reason that they are named in a similar fashion is because 
            Java was becoming very popular at the time, and the creators of 
            JavaScript thought that they could benefit from Java’s popularity 
            by adopting a similar name. This seems a little like the current 
            naming convention involving adding Blockchain or Cryptocurrency to 
            various new products.
        </p>
        <p>
            A final interesting fact about JavaScript — its creator, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich</a>, 
            wrote the prototype of the language 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Beginnings_at_Netscape" 
            title="History of JavaScript (Wikipedia)">in just 10 days</a>. A pretty 
            fast start for a programming language that has been going strong 
            for 23 years!
        </p>
        <h3>HTML, CSS, and JS</h3>
        <p>
            How do the three languages we’ve talked about so far relate?   
        </p>
        <p>
            As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, HTML creates the framework, and CSS adds the style.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/img/html-vs-css.png" alt="An image comparing HTML and CSS">
            <figcaption>HTML creates the framework; CSS adds the style</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            If you leave it at the, you can still have a beautiful, fully 
            functional website only using HTML and CSS. A website like this, 
            however, is considered static — you can’t change elements without 
            reloading the page. JavaScript allows you to create dynamic websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the above example of a house, JavaScript would allow you to 
            click on the front door and see the door open, and your neighbors 
            walk out!
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/img/html-vs-css-vs-js-house.png" alt="An image comparing JS to a House">
            <figcaption>JavaScript creates reactive websites — Similar to being able to click on a house and open the door</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            You’ve likely seen examples of JavaScript all over the web. 
            Examples might include: pressing the “like” button on Facebook and 
            seeing the total number of “likes” instantly increase. Or, as you 
            scroll through Instagram, a post changes from “posted 3 minutes 
            ago” to “posted 4 minutes ago” in real time. JavaScript allows you 
            to create dynamic, reactive websites, the type of website 
            functionality that users have come to expect across the web.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges: Resizing Websites (CSS) and Logic Errors (JavaScript)</h3>
        <p>
            Two challenges that I faced this week involved attempting to make 
            this blog viewable on mobile devices, and trying to get my Silly 
            Story Generator program to work using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            After initializing the blog last week, I managed to get it so that 
            it looked pretty good on a desktop browser.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="imgBorder" src="../assets/img/css-looks-good-on-desktop.png" alt="CSS looking good on Desktop">
            <figcaption>A blog post viewed from a computer</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            I realized, however, that there was a problem with how this 
            arrangement scaled down to mobile. What looks nice and spacious on 
            a widescreen, became very compressed on a mobile device.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="imgBorder" src="../assets/img/css-not-scaling-well-to-mobile.png" alt="CSS not scaling well to mobile view">
            <figcaption>The same blog post viewed on a mobile device</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, attempting to remedy this made things much worse 
            before they got any better. For a while, not only did the site not 
            look good on mobile, but elements started to appear in strange 
            places on desktop as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although we learned about Git in our first week of Prework, it 
            wasn’t until I attempted to resize my blog that I became a real 
            believer. I should first say that this came about <em>not</em> 
            because I used Git properly and that it helped me to fix my 
            website, but rather, that I didn’t use a good Gitflow Strategy, 
            and that I ended up wishing fervently that I had!
        </p>
        <p>
            I was using a “dev” (development) branch to write my code, but 
            only doing so so that I could get into the habit. Once I had an 
            update, I would immediately merge with the local master branch and 
            then push to GitHub. This was unfortunate, because even though my code  
            was moving in the right direction, things, at least temporarily, 
            looked worse than before. If I had been using Git properly, I 
            could have left my master branch as a functioning version of the 
            site, while working on my dev branch until things were up to 
            publication quality. This process definitely made be a believer in 
            the usefulness of using a Version Control System like Git!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A second thing that I struggled with this week was encountering 
            logic errors in my <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/silly-story/" 
            title="Robbie's Silly Story Generator">Silly Story Generator</a>. 
            The SSG is supposed to take a string of text and, somewhat 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs" 
            title="Mad Libs Wikipedia">Mad Libs</a> style, insert funny 
            characters and locations to generate a new “silly story” each time 
            the “generate” button is pressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A piece of additional functionality that I wanted to add involved 
            creating a Typewriter Effect, where each letter would appear one 
            at a time, as if being typed. Needless to say, this did not work 
            as planned either the first (or twenty-first) time that I tried to 
            run the program. The first thing that I looked for were syntax 
            errors. You can think of these as grammar or spelling mistakes. 
            This is like when you text someone: “on my way, soon” when you 
            really meant to say “one my way, noon” — A simple error that might 
            have someone waiting around for several hours. Computers being 
            very literal machines, these simple grammar and spelling errors 
            can cause a program to cease functioning entirely. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After first addressing any syntactical errors that I could find in 
            my Silly Story Generator, I then had to deal with any logic 
            errors. A logic error is when you tell a program how to perform a 
            task, they are able to complete said task, but then, because of an 
            error in the logic of your instructions, the task completed does 
            not produce the desired results. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A real-world example of a logic error could be to give someone 
            directions to your house. Perhaps you managed to spell everything 
            correctly and produce easy to follow directions (no syntax 
            errors), but you then told them to turn left on Main St. instead 
            of right! The instructions worked well, they just sent your friend 
            in the wrong direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found dealing with logic errors really frustrating. I would find 
            myself reading and rereading my code, and eventually coming to the 
            conclusion that my code definitely <em>should</em> work; It 
            <em>seemed</em> like everything made sense. There were even 
            moments when I would just stare at the screen, unable to find 
            anything to tweak or try.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seemed like there were no real “ah-ha” moments of getting this 
            week's code to work — rather than a large change that fixed the 
            program, it was several small implementations that eventually 
            built some functioning code. 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer" 
            title="Pragmatic Programmer Wikipedia">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> 
            mentions a Japanese phrase, “kaizen”. This is the process of 
            making small, incremental improvements that over time produce high 
            quality results. This is what the process of debugging both this 
            blog and my Silly Story Generator felt like — the more time I 
            spent working on the problem, and the more I slowly pieced 
            together bits of functionality, the closer I got to a program that 
            ran as I intended!
        </p>
        <h3>Two Cool Things</h3>
        <p>
            I wanted to mention two things that I learned this week that I 
            found really interesting. When working in HTML, there is a lot of 
            framework that gets recycled on every page. After my first couple 
            of webpages, I got tired of repeatedly building the same 
            structure. I had decided that it would be really useful to build a 
            template to start with. It was then that fellow Bootcamper 
            <a href="https://anchormansam.github.io/my-blog/blog.html" 
            title="A link to Sam's Blog">Sam</a> mentioned a useful shortcut 
            in the class Slack (groupchat). He mentioned a shortcut in VS 
            Code Studio (software that you can use to write code in), where, 
            if you enter <code>!</code> and press return, then a great HTML 
            template will appear. This was a significantly quicker and more 
            convenient way to build a starting framework — thanks Sam!
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/img/vs-code-!-template.png" alt="VS Code '!' Shortcut">
            <figcaption>Using the "!" Shortcut in VS Code</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            A second really useful thing that we learned this week came from 
            our instructor, <a href="https://www.justinhall.com" 
            title="Justin's Website">Justin</a>. Justin walked us through the 
            process of using the Chrome Dev Tools to debug a program. When I 
            was attempting to fix my logic errors in the Silly Story 
            Generator, it would have been really helpful to see how the 
            computer was interpreting my code. For example, if my code wasn’t 
            displaying a string pulled from an array, is that because it isn’t 
            pulling the string from the array at all, or is the computer 
            having trouble inputting said string back into our story? With 
            Chrome Dev Tools, you are able to insert a breakpoint, and to then 
            <em>see</em> how the computer is thinking. In the example photo 
            below, my code is shown on the left, and what values the computer 
            is using is shown on the rights. 
        </p>

            alt="Chrome Dev Tools: Breakpoint Function">
            <figcaption>An example of the Chrome Dev Tools</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <p>
            The resource that I wanted to share this week is less of a useful 
            tool and more of a really cool inspiration! While working through 
            this week’s 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript#So_what_can_it_really_do" 
            title="MDN: 'What is JavaScript?'">
            MDN reading on JavaScript</a>, they mentioned that some 
            programmers are doing some really cool things with audio and video 
            <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API’s</abbr>. As 
            an example, they gave use a link to the 
            <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/chrome"
            title="Chrome Experiments">Chrome Experiments webpage</a>. This 
            site showcased a lot of really fun and interesting webpages built 
            using the JavaScript framework. As cool and inspirational as these 
            projects were, they also left me with a sense of just how vast of a 
            field of knowledge web development really is. It feels as though we 
            are years (more likely even, decades) away from doing anything as 
            remotely cool and complex as this. That said, I do really 
            recommend that you check out a few of these projects — I thought 
            that they really pushed the boundaries of what a reactive and 
            responsive website can do!
