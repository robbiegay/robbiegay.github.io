            I’m writing this on a Saturday — we’ve just wrapped up our third 
            week of Bootcamp Prework, and are barreling full steam ahead 
            towards the final work of remote learning. Starting on Sept. 
            16<sup>th</sup>, we will be reporting in to Awesome Inc., meeting 
            Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm for 12 weeks. I’m very excited, but maybe 
            also a little nervous.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week involved diving a little deeper into HTML and CSS, while 
            also serving as an introduction to JavaScript. Additionally, we 
            did our first Demo Day on Friday! As we are working remotely, this 
            was done via group video chat. We all took turns demonstrating the 
            functionality of our Silly Story Generators, as well as looking 
            under the hood and showcasing/explaining the source code behind 
            our projects.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a coding language that is used on both the client 
            and server sides. On the client side, it is used to add reactive 
            elements to a website. JavaScript <strong>IS NOT</strong> the same 
            as the similarly popular programing language, Java. In fact, the 
            only reason that they are named in a similar fashion is because 
            Java was becoming very popular at the time, and the creators of 
            JavaScript thought that they could benefit from Java’s popularity 
            by adopting a similar name. This seems a little like the current 
            naming convention involving adding Blockchain or Cryptocurrency to 
            various new products.
        </p>
        <p>
            A final interesting fact about JavaScript — its creator, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich</a>, 
            wrote the prototype of the langugage 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Beginnings_at_Netscape" 
            title="History of JavaScript (Wikipedia)">in just 10 days</a>. A pretty 
            fast start for a programming language that has been going strong 
            for 23 years!
        </p>
        <h3>HTML, CSS, and JS</h3>
        <p>
            How do the three languages we’ve talked about so far relate?   
        </p>
        <p>
            As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, HTML creates the framework, and CSS adds the style.
        </p>

            <img src="../assets/img/html-vs-css.png" alt="An image comparing HTML and CSS">
            <figcaption>HTML creates the framework; CSS adds the style</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            If you leave it at the, you can still have a beautiful, fully 
            functional website only using HTML and CSS. A website like this, 
            however, is considered static — you can’t change elements without 
            reloading the page. JavaScript allows you to create dynamic websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the above example of a house, JavaScript would allow you to 
            click on the front door and see the door open, and your neighbors 
            walk out!
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/img/html-vs-css-vs-js-house.png" alt="An image comparing JS to a House">
            <figcaption>JavaScript creates reactive websites — Similar to being able to click on a house and open the door</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            You’ve likely seen examples of JavaScript all over the web. 
            Examples might include: pressing the “like” button on Facebook and 
            seeing the total number of “likes” instantly increase. Or, as you 
            scroll through Instagram, a post changes from “posted 3 minutes 
            ago” to “posted 4 minutes ago” in real time. JavaScript allows you 
            to create dynamic, reactive websites, the type of website 
            functionality that users have come to expect across the web.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges: Resizing websites (CSS) and Logic Errors (JavaScript)</h3>
        <p>
            Two challenges that I faced this week involved attempting to make 
            this blog viewable on mobile devices, and trying to get my Silly 
            Story Generator program to work using JavaScript.
