                <ul>
                    <li>We spent Prework Week 1 learning about Git and GitHub. I don't have any projects to share from
                        this first week, but you can read more about what we did in my <a href="posts/pw-week-1.html">Prework Week 1 Blog Post</a>!

                        <li>
                            Structured a letter using appropriate HTML tags. Started with overall document tags 
                            ("<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>", "<code>&lt;html&gt;</code>", 
                            "<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>", and "<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>"), and then 
                            added various block level ("<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>", "<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>", etc) 
                            and inline semantics ("<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>", "<code>&lt;em &gt;</code>", etc).

                        <li>
                            Created different resolutions of project images. Embedded a YouTube video onto the page. 
                            Created responsive images using “<code>src</code>”, “<code>alt</code>”, “<code>srcset</code>”, 
                            and “<code>sizes</code>” attributes as well as creating an Art Directed element using 
                            <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> .

                        <li>
                            Took a Silly Story string and inserted various silly people/events which we pulled 
                            from two different arrays. Also added functionality to switch between US, and UK measurement 
                            systems (as well as a third "Easter Egg" unit of measurement, found via hovering 
                            your mouse over it). Additionally, added a Typewriter Effect that made use of a 
                            loop which would print one letter at a time before waiting and moving on to the 
                            next letter.

                </ul>
                <li>Prework Week 4 (9/9/19 - 9/15/19)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/image-gallery/">Created an Image Gallery</a></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Created an image gallery that allows the user to click through 5 image thumbnails 
                        which, when selected, enlarge and replace the previously displayed image. Also 
                        included a button which allows users to "lighten" or "darken" the image — a function similar  
                        to those included in many basic photo display programs. 
                        The main problem that I had with getting this software to work involved figuring out 
                        how to use <code>event.target</code> in JavaScript to select each image as it was 
                        created in a loop. Otherwise, the loop would complete and replace the currently 
                        targeted image with the last image + 1 (i.e. the loop ends on pic5.jpg, this 
                        would attempt to target a fictional pic6.jpg).

                        <li>
                        Created a digital clock interface that tells the current time. Included button to switch 
                        between Military (default) and Civil time.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Created a timer that counts down to a user-inputted date and time. The display counts down in 
                        units of years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. When that date and time is reached, the display reads 
                        "DONE!!!" and a "reset" button appears to allow the user to initiate a new countdown.

                        This program can read your mind!! Seriously, try it out. The computer will guide you 
                        through a series of 4 questions and will then be able to tell you the symbol you were 
                        thinking of. Uses some sort of cutting-edge Bluetooth waves to read your mind (or something 
                        like that..)
